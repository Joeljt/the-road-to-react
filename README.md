# Tips for React Beginners

### Fundamental 
- A React component decalred as a function must have a catipalized name, otherwize that function would not be treated as a component.

- Everything inside a function component would be run mutilple times during re-renders, so define variables outside the component to avoid re-defines.

### JSX is the key

- JSX replaces several vanilla HTML attributes to better working with React, and the camelCase naming is used as well, such as `htmlFor`„ÄÅ`onClick` or `className`, etc.
But these replacements are development-only, all of these attributes get translated back to their native variant.

### List in React

- When composing UI component with React and JSX, we just use vanilla HTML and JS and that's all. No magic directive, no templating syntax, just JavaScript.
- Use Array#map to obtain a list of JSX, and every list item should have a unique identifier, which is used for React to identify different element to apply changes efficiently.

- Use the index as an item key for the last resort, as it may comes with lots of unexpected behaviors.
- returning null in React to render nothing at that moment or position

### React element and instantiation

- `Decalaring a React component` is just the declaration of the function or the class
- After the declaration, we could use this component in our JSX, and that make the component instantiated, and React will render it as a `React element`
- And that React element is also called `the instance of the React component`.
- Although we just use a component in the JSX using a angle brackets (e.g. <Greeting />), but React is using React.createElement API to create React element for us under the hood.
- Always use angle brackets to render a React component, and NEVER call it with parenthesis if you're declaring a function component.

### StrictMode Component
- use StrictMode to help you find bugs more easily and early
- component wrapped by strict mode will run another render to find redundant re-renders, and try to make your component pure enough to ignore the extra rendering triggered by strict mode component
- hooks inside a strict mode component hierachy will run an extra setup-cleanup procedure to help you find missing cleanup
- using of legacy API would get warnings inside a strict mode component

### Handler function
- Declare a function to handle the DOM event is very common in React, and those functions are called handler functions
- the event will be passed to the handler function, and that event is synthetic, not the original DOM event
- React has handled all the preventDefault works for developers under the hood
- use `event.nativeEvent` to get the original DOM event if that's your case

### Props and callback handlers
- Use props to comunicate with child component from a parent component, props are only passed downwards
- Use callback handler to do the comunication the other way around
- Make use of `useState` to handle a stateful status or variant in a React component
    - note that the mechanism of `useState` hook to better understand it when the state is mutated asynchornously

- Problem here
    - Lifted the state in Search component to the App component, and set the value and handle callback with props, but the input is totally uncontrollable, why?
    - it turns out that I make a typo mistake, resulting the input have no onChange callback

### Lifting State
- If a state introduced inside a child component would be useful for its parent component, then we should lift that state to the parent component, and pass it down to the child component
- A state should always be there where all components which depend on it can read(via props) and update(via callback handler) it.
- be careful about the props passed downwards, child shouldn't be concerned about computing if the data can be handled by the parent.

### Controlled Components
- If either the input or the output of a component is not controlled by React, we call the component itself is an uncontrolled component, and the element inside the component is an uncontrolled element.
- Only if both the input and the output are controlled by React, not some internal state of vanilla HTML, can we call that component a controlled component.
- Controlled Components are just like pure functions, which is more prefered during our development, to get rid of side effects and obtain a predictable behavior.
